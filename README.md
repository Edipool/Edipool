About me
I started my way to DS by studying [the basics of statistics on Stepik](https://stepik.org/course/76/syllabus) on my own in April 2021, and in August of the same year I fell in love with Python and realized that I wanted to link my future work with it and become at least a little bit as cool as [Valery Babushkin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/venheads/). Before discovering DS for myself, I worked in the environmental industry for six years, where for the last three years I worked as the head of the project department whose purpose was to control waste management.
